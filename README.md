# FScript+SIMBL Plugin

This is a System Preferences PrefPane for toggling a SIMBL plugin to inject the FScript menu item into applications. On the FScript website they gave an alternative way to do this, but it did not work for me on OS X Lion. So, I wrote a small preference pane to toggle the SIMBL plugin for me.

Enjoy.
